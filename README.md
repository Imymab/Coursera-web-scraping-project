# Coursera-web-scraping-project

As part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Alex The Analyst on YouTube, I developed a Python script using BeautifulSoup and Requests library to scrape data from Coursera. 

The script allows me to extract valuable information about a specific course, including the course title, instructor, university, ratings, difficulty level, language, and enrollment status. By automating the process, I can stay up-to-date with the latest course details and analyze the data to gain insights into popular online courses. 

To enhance the functionality, I incorporated email notifications using SMTP. Whenever there is a change in the enrollment count, the script triggers an email notification to keep me informed. This automation saves me time and ensures I never miss any important updates.
